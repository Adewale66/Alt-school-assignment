				<h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
				<p>
					I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who
					takes the time to continue learning even though it's not a
					direct requirement of the job. I find that many times it's a
					combination of what you study both directly and indirectly
					related to work. I am modest, but hard working and I
					consistently sets firm goals for myself. Then, once I've
					defined the benchmarks, I take the necessary steps to
					achieve those milestones. I am someone who has an unwavering
					resolve. I am determined to do well in anything I set my
					mind to and is determined to have a successful career.

					My favorite quote by Steve Jobs is
					<b>
						"If you're afraid of failing then you won't get very
						far."</b
